Here the token probably exploded due to being a microcap, and not even needing large whales to shoot up the price, dev immediately rugged (imagine the dev giving themselves 80% of total supply when he created the token); went ahead and sold all his tokens (dumped his tokens into the pool in exchange for sol) and caused the price to probably plummet afterwards. You probably caught your wallrt when the price spiked, but tried to sell after the dev rugged and there was little amount of sol left in the pool, making you technically a whale trying to dump into such a small lp pool.', 'Long story short the money is gone.

They even perform test transactions to see if the contract allows you to sell etc (ie. ‚Äúhoneypots‚Äù do not).\n\nObviously scam logic baked into the contract and other data about the holders of the coin are only part of the equation.\n\nOutside of getting better at avoiding the obvious scams by using apps, you need to develop your own process for vetting coins - usually by analyzing trade activity, the main holder wallets, and the social signals of the community behind the coin.\n\nAt the end of the day it‚Äôs hard and requires legit skill (as well as luck) else the opportunity wouldn‚Äôt exist.

Prophet is never made until you actually sell which can only occur after you found enough people to pay the current price for everything you own\n\nNo asset has infinite money sitting around waiting to buy what you want to sell. This is the huge mistake most people make. Just because one person buys one coin or otherwise does one transaction at a certain price does not actually mean every single coin is worth that amount. Nothing is worth anything unless somebody is willing to pay that price. Risking a couple of dollars to inflate the price of a coin is within the budget of every single person playing meme coins but no one is going to risk $100k+, unless they are willing to gamble they can find someone else to pay even more. Market cap numbers never take into account actual demand at the highest price. Market cap calculations always represent a pure theoretical maximum value if there was sufficient demand to turn over every coin at that price which of course they're never is because all assets go up and down based on supply and demand.\n\nThere's absolutely nothing confusing about it at all.

Let me break it down for you in simple terms:\n\n\t1.\tWhat Happened?\n\nYou invested $30 in a token, and its value supposedly skyrocketed to over $373,000 in just 15 minutes. However, you were unable to sell the token due to something called ‚Äúhigh impact‚Äù and slippage. This means you couldn‚Äôt actually realize or withdraw that massive gain.\n\n\t2.\tWhy Couldn‚Äôt You Sell?\n\nThis likely happened for one of two reasons:\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tLow Liquidity: When a token doesn‚Äôt have enough money (or liquidity) in its trading pool, there‚Äôs no one to buy the token from you when you try to sell. This is why selling your tokens would cause a ‚Äúhigh impact‚Äù on the price, making it nearly impossible to get the value you see.\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tSmart Contract Restrictions: Some tokens are designed with malicious code that makes it impossible for regular users to sell their tokens. Only the developers (or specific wallets) can cash out.\n\n\t3.\tWhat is Slippage?\n\nSlippage is the difference between the price you expect to get and the price you actually get during a transaction. For illiquid or scammy tokens, slippage can be set so high that your transaction fails or you lose most of the value when trying to sell.\n\n\t4.\tWhat is a Rug Pull?\n\nA ‚Äúrug pull‚Äù is a scam where the developers of a token generate hype, attract investors, and then remove all the liquidity from the market. This makes the token worthless, leaving investors \nunable to sell or recover their funds.\n\n\t5.\tCould You Have Cashed Out?\n\nIn cases like this, the answer is almost always no. The value shown in your wallet is not real‚Äîit‚Äôs just a number based on the current token price, but you‚Äôd need buyers or liquidity to actually convert it to real money, which isn‚Äôt available in scams like this.\n\n\t6.\tWhat Can You Do in the Future?\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tResearch: Always investigate tokens \nbefore buying. Check if they have sufficient liquidity and look into their smart contract (if possible).\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tStick to Reputable Projects: Focus on established tokens or those backed by verified teams and exchanges.\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tBe Wary of Unrealistic Gains: If it seems too good to be true, it usually is.\n\nUnfortunately, in this case, it seems you‚Äôve encountered a scam.

How does one cash out if they have hit a fortune like this on a Memecoin ?

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/solana) if you have any questions or concerns.*', 'Many of these comments are wrong, and also didn\'t really explain liquidity like you asked so I\'ll give it a go.\n\nImagine you have two goods, apples and oranges. Let\'s say the exchange rate is one apple for two oranges. If someone has apples and wants to obtain oranges, they need to find someone to buy their apples. However, with a decentralized exchange like Uniswap, it is known as an automated market maker, or AMM.\n\nThe way an AMM operates is based off of liquidity pools, which can be pictured as a bucket of two assets that allows traders to easily buy and sell these two assets. To continue with our scenario above, we can picture our apple/orange liquidity pool as a giant bucket full of oranges and apples.\n\nIf our bucket has millions of oranges and apples, then it becomes very easy for a person to swap their goods in and out. If I want to exchange 100 apples for 200 oranges, I can easily just throw my apples into the pool and receive my 200 oranges. Because there are now slightly more apples and oranges according to our 1:2 ratio, the ""price"" must adjust accordingly. Since there are millions of apples and oranges, the impact is very low. (To be specific here, you would actually receive just under 200 oranges because there is always SOME amount of price impact, but in a pool with deep liquidity it\'s minimal).\n\nNow imagine there are only 200 apples and 400 oranges in the pool. And I have 100 apples I want to exchange. I now have 50% of the current pool, meaning the impact in the ratio of apples:oranges will be massive, and I will receive much less than the advertised price of 1 apple : 2 oranges.\n\nThis is the same logic with liquidity pools in crypto, where there are two tokens, typically a network token (ETH/SOL/etc) and then your custom token (CHILLGUY in this case).\n\nIf we look at the current amount of CHILLGUY tokens in the pool, it\'s 11.2m at this time. This trader is sitting on 9.3m tokens, so it\'s very close to our apples/oranges scenario.\n\nMany of the other comments about the best strategy to sell are correct - selling slowly over time is the best way to do this, because typically there will be buyers over time to offset your sells (aka adding more liquidity for you to then sell into).\n\nHope this helps.', ""You are right in a way,They can't cashout so they create hype around it so new buyers come in and they slowly swap their tokens, apes together strong - diamond hands."", 'He can cashout slowlyx', 'Ignore all the airheads in here.

Although, if he sells in small chunks instead of one big batch, he would benefit from the volume filling some of his sell positions and being able to sell at better prices in chunks than selling at once, but even though he sold in chunks, holding 60% of the liquidity would definitely crash the coin even sold off in chunks as people would start panic selling as well. He would at max maybe get $2mil out if he is lucky. \n\nHope this helps.', 'Jupiter DCA, you can set sell orders in small clips each x amount of time.

But DeFi doesn\'t work like regular banking, there\'s no automated backend processing stuff\n- Anyone can be a liquidator and can ""trigger"" the liquidation of Bob\'s position, since it has now become eligible for liquidation\n- For successfully doing so the liquidator gets a bounty (reward)\n- When there are large market movements lots of DeFi positions become eligible for liquidation, just like Bob\'s\n- Liquidators are racing to collect bounties by being the first to liquidate positions\n- To do this they submit the transaction dozens or hundreds of times to the network in order to ensure their attempt succeeds\n- The network isn\'t sufficiently removing duplicate transactions before processing and verifying them, which is a compute intense process\n- As a result the network is stuck trying to sift through all the ""spam"" from the liquidation bots\n- Changes implemented in the new release 1.8.14 fix a lot of this, this is being tested on mainnet now with 8% of stake, as it is confirmed to be stable it\'ll be further rolled out\n- There has been an incredible and exponential explosion of DeFi usage in recent months which didn\'t exist six months ago or a year ago, DeFi transactions are much much more ""expensive"" to compute so the amount of ""compute"" the network is doing has increase massively. Earlier the inefficiencies around deduplication weren\'t a problem as the compute load was lower but now this has become a bottle neck.\n- Hopefully 1.8.14 makes significant inroads in fixing this, but right now all we can do is be patient and trust that everyone capable is working very hard on this.', ""I've been sitting here all day watching the bar move closer to liquidation on Solend, but I can't do a thing to stop it.

The main difference is that Sol is experiencing an exponential growth. Eth had plenty of problems as well in the beginning. This is why Eth is going with POS. Any company (Amazon) or smart contract fortunate enough to grow exponentially do suffer growing pains. Even now Google, Amazon Web Services, and FB suffer from server outages from time to time. What you should focus on is the developers and it‚Äôs leadership behind Sol. If you do not have faith in them, you should go with other smart contracts. But always be mindful, there is a reason why Sol is having an exponential growth. This team is competent and professional.', 'FUD ; It never ‚Äúfailed‚Äù there was ‚Äúcongestion‚Äù. Even with the congestion Solana still outperformed Eth,cardano,etc.\n\nCardano recently had congestion issues and Eth also had it‚Äôs fair share of issues as well and SOL is used more than any alts. \n\nSomeone in here tried comparing ‚ÄúHydra‚Äù to Sol so Let‚Äôs do some comparisons. \n\nThe notorious Hydra is just the name Cardano is giving to its proposed L2 scaling solutions (think multiple chains).  With Hydra, Cardano wants to add tons of these for scalability to raise the ceiling on TPS.  So the numbers you are comparing aren‚Äôt really Solana vs Cardano they are Solana vs dozens and dozens of chains all running at once staked on top of Cardano.  This is exactly what ETH is doing with their scaling efforts, and Solana could absolutely do the same if it needed to.  The thing is though, Solana already is processing more traffic than any other L1 and barely touches 3,000 TPS half the time.  They could 15x that traffic and still not have to change how they are built or add any L2‚Äôs.  Cardano seems to be increasing the complexity of its chain for capacity it doesn‚Äôt need (nothing is happening there, or anywhere, to make them need that kind of throughput).  Also, the moment those chains have to validate each other you lose the benefits of scaling that way (intra shard versus inter shard communication have totally different levels of speed and efficiency).  That‚Äôs why developers try to give them other names like ‚Äútransaction layers‚Äù.  They don‚Äôt benefit from the decentralization of the L1 and aren‚Äôt interconnected the way you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd be.  It creates a mess that you shouldn‚Äôt create unless the capacity is seriously needed beyond your L1.  Ethereum has a real use case for doing this, Cardano doing this would make no sense at all because there isn‚Äôt an army of things competing for network space.  It‚Äôs unneeded complexity for the sake of unused capacity.\n\nSo to answer your question, Hydra is just Cardano‚Äôs name for L2 scaling like what ETH is doing.  When you compare the numbers pumped by chains using L2‚Äôs you are really comparing many many chains stacked on top of each other to Solana‚Äôs single L1.  Solana could absolutely and very easily add L2‚Äôs if it wanted to, but it doesn‚Äôt have a need to as it is nowhere near maxed out at L1, and adding complexity and inefficiency to the network for the sake of TPS that you aren‚Äôt using isn‚Äôt terribly wise.  Cardano pumping the TPS they‚Äôd get from these efforts (which absolutely adds unneeded complexity and inefficiency to their ecosystem), feels like an unpopular store spending all their money to build a bigger parking lot, despite not having any customers.  You should probably get people there and get things happening and use up the capacity that you have before worrying about stuff like this.  Hope that helps, and good luck!', 'A lot of you must be new to crypto.
